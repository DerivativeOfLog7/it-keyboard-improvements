# it-keyboard-improvements
Extremely simple [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) 2.0 scripts to add some much needed features to the Italian keyboard layout.   
I decided to share it in case anyone else finds it useful or want to use it as inspiration to create their own for their needs.  
Currently contains three hotkeys for characters whose absence I find inexcusable in the keyboard layout (´\`~), accented uppercase vowels (ÀÈÉÌÒÙ) (was it that hard to assign a shortcut to them when the keyboard layout was created??), the schwa (ə), and a few mathematical symbols. There's also a version which contains all greek letters that don't have [homoglyphs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoglyph) in the latin scripts; since I don't think many people need those I separated them. 
More symbols will be added as I see the need to have quick access on them for my use cases.

AltGr + 9 is the set intersection symbol, AltGr + Shift + 9 is the set union symbol, AltGr + Shift + Z is lowercase Σ in word-final position

Additionally: 
* ←↑→↓ with AltGr + Arrow keys
* ⇒ (implies) with AltGr + Shift + Right arrow key
* ⟺ (if and only if) with AltGr + Shift + Left arrow key
* ⟂ (perpendicular) with AltGr + Shift + Down arrow key
